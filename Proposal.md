# Public Health Proposals
## Currently consists of two questions to be answered
* both are two month contracts (10 weeks)

1. Neurologic sequelae covid (1 contract awarded)
  * Start Date: October 24, 2022
  * Stop Date: November 25, 2022
  * Question: What is the spectrum of neurologic sequelae at 12 months following infection in survivors of acute COVID, compared to individuals who have not had COVID?
    * More severe than initial
    * Same as initial
    * Less severe than initial

2. SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection Severity (1 contract awarded)
  * Start Date: October 24, 2022
  * Stop Date: November 25, 2022
  * Question: Does reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to first infection produce clinical illness that is more severe, the same as, or less severe compared to initial SARS-CoV-2 infection?  
    * More severe than initial
    * Same as initial
    * Less severe than initial



* Deliverables: Written report within the N3C Enclave Â detailing the quantitative findings from analyses that support conclusions that address the overall research questions and Aims; providing sufficient methodologic details for independent replication of the work; and an interpretation of the findings and study limitations.  All code generated to complete the work, provided in a deployable format and with sufficient documentation/annotation for independent deployment to permit validation. (code that can be exported to Git)
* Contracts Aim:
  1. Assess whether the main findings reported in this study are replicated in the more diverse population of the N3C enclave.
  2. Quantitatively describe the key differences from the linked study, including but not limited to demographic differences, differences in covariates, and differences in the influences of specific covariates on the outcomes of interest

## Proposals will be reviews by:
  * Subcontractor: [AXLE](https://axleinfo.com/)
  * then by NCAT review committee

## Proposal sections discussed in webinar (if granted contract):
  * 1-2 pages
  * detailed methodology
  * midterm status update (week 5)
  * weekly meetings with AXLE technicians if needed
  * detailed analysis and results documentation
    * approach taken
    * pipeline implemented
    * results need to be made available (can be exported to Git)

* Publishing work was also encouraged following N3C guidelines
